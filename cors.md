🔹 What is CORS?

1. CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
2. It’s a security rule built into browsers that controls which websites can request data from another website’s server.


🔹 Breaking it down with an example
Imagine:
- You are on website A → https://myapp.com
- Your app wants to fetch data from website B → https://api.example.com
🔸 By default, browsers block requests from one domain (myapp.com) to another (api.example.com) for security reasons.
- This is called the Same-Origin Policy.

👉 Same-Origin means:
Same protocol (https),
Same domain (myapp.com),
If any of these differ → browser considers it cross-origin.

🔹 So where does CORS come in?
- CORS is a way for the server (api.example.com) to say:
- “Hey browser, it’s okay, I allow https://myapp.com to access my data.”
- It does this by sending a special header in its response:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myapp.com

🔹 Why CORS Exists?
- ✅ Protects users from malicious sites stealing data
- ✅ Server decides who can access its resources
- ✅ Keeps the web safe

🔹 How Developers Fix CORS Issues
- Server-side fix → add correct CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin).
- Proxy server → frontend talks to your own backend, backend fetches data from external API.
- Browser extensions / local dev hacks (only for testing, not production).
